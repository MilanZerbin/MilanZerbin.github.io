currently I am a PhD Student of [Kai Cieliebak](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/mntf/math/prof/geom/kai-cieliebak/) at [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/), Germany. 
I am generally interested in algebraic and differential topology, lately my new focus lies on String Topology as well as Piecewise Linear Symplectic Geometry.
See [my past research projects](/activities/research/past) for an overview of what i have done before.
