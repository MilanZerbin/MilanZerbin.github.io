## The Nash--Moser Inverse Function Theorem

During the week 18-25 of June 2023, i attended for the already second time the annual Augsburg-Potsdam joint "Blockseminar", this year lodging in [Hotel Bollmannsruh](https://bollmannsruh-am-beetzsee.allbrandenburghotels.com/de/) at Beetzsee, Brandenburg.

This years goal was to learn all about Frechet spaces and the proof of the inverse function theorem of Nash and Moser.
We stuck close to Hamiltons excellent and freely accesible [book on the topic](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-7/issue-1/The-inverse-function-theorem-of-Nash-and-Moser/bams/1183549049.full).
You can find the schedule of the Seminar [here](/bs/two/plan.pdf).

## Organization

The seminar was organized by [Christian BÃ¤r](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/baer) and [Bernhard Hanke](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/mntf/math/prof/diff/team/bernhard-hanke/) with help from Christoph Stephan.

Talks were to be given via document camera by writing on paper.
The writings from all talks were then digitized with a scanner, at some point i will append them on this page.
