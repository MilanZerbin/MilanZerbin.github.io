## Ricci Flow and the sphere-theorem

During the week 10-14 of June 2025, i attended for the fourth time now the annual Augsburg-Potsdam joint "Blockseminar", this year lodging in [Hotel Bollmannsruh](https://bollmannsruh-am-beetzsee.allbrandenburghotels.com/de/) at Beetzsee, Brandenburg.

This years goal was to learn the technique of ricci flow, guided by the [book of S. Brendle](https://www.ams.org/books/gsm/111/gsm111-endmatter.pdf). 
You can find the schedule of the Seminar [here](/bs/four/plan.pdf).
