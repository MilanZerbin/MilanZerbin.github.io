## Symplectic Dynamics and Topology

During the week 16-20 of June 2025, i had the pleasure to attend a wonderful summerschool in the pittoresque [Gran Hotel San Michele](https://www.grandhotelsanmichele.it/) in Calabria, Italy.

Next to meeting loads of inspiring young researchers of the symplectic world and beyond, no matter my limited understanding i had a great time listening to the four lecture series held there:

 - Marie-Claude Arnaud: *Conformal symplectic dynamics*
 - Viktor Ginzburg: *Symplectic dynamics*
 - Michael Hutchings: *Low dimensional symplectic dynamics*
 - Claude Viterbo: *Completion of the set of Lagrangians and applications to dynamics*

**At your own risk:** Clicking on any of the lecture series guides you to the download of my hardly readable chaotic handwritten notes from their talks.

Alternatively, you can check out more details on the [website of the school](https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/cime/c-i-m-e-courses/c-i-m-e-courses-2025/symplectic-dynamics-and-topology?authuser=0).
