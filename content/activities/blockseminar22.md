## H-principles and Convex Integration

During the first week in may 2022, i attended for my first time the annual Augsburg-Potsdam joint "Blockseminar", that year lodging in [Kloster Frauenwörth](https://www.frauenwoerth.de/) on the Chiemsee in Bavaria.

We spent the week learning about convex integration, proving the h-principle for open and ample relations and discussing applications.
You can find the schedule of the seminar [here](/bs/two/plan.pdf).

## Organization

The seminar was organized by [Christian Bär](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/baer) and [Bernhard Hanke](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/mntf/math/prof/diff/team/bernhard-hanke/) with help from Artem Nepechy. 

Talks were to be given via document camera by writing on paper. 
The writings from all talks were digitized by [Georg Frenck](www.frenck.net/Math).
