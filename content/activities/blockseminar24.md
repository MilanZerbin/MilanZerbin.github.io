## Scalar curvature: Rigidity and Flexibility

During the week 28. of April to 03. of May 2024, i attended for the third time the annual Augsburg-Potsdam joint "Blockseminar", this year lodging in [Kloster Banz](https://bad-staffelstein.de/de/tourismus/bad-staffelstein/sehenswuerdigkeiten/kloster-banz.php?wt_campaign=short) at Beetzsee, Brandenburg.

This years goal was to learn about flexibility and rigidity phenomenons of scalar curvature.
You can find the schedule of the Seminar [here](/bs/three/plan.pdf).

## Organization

The seminar was organized by [Christian BÃ¤r](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/baer) and [Bernhard Hanke](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/mntf/math/prof/diff/team/bernhard-hanke/) with help from Georg Frenck.

Talks were to be given via document camera by writing on paper.
The writings from all talks were then digitized with a scanner, at some point i will append them on this page.
